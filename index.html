    <h1>My Story</h1>
    <p><img src="img/prabhat.jpg" alt="Relevant textual alternative to the image"  height="200" width="200"> It all started with my first interaction with computers back in
      June 2006, when I used it first time to see my result online. I wrote my number in one
      textbox, clicked on submit button, and my result with all details appeared
      within one or two minutes, the internet was quite slow in those days.
      While I realized intuitively that somewhere my result was stored along
      with others, and my number was my identification, at that time I had no
      real idea what happened behind the monitor. After that my interaction
      with computers kept increasing in the form of excel related works,
      listening music, collecting various information and news with questions
      getting piled up in my mind, like How did that happen? From where
      did that information come? How come that pop-up suddenly come from nowhere?
      With eagerness for getting answers to all such questions, a career in Computer
      Science was an obvious choice for me. And three years later in 2009 when
      I joined my undergraduate Program in computer science, these mysteries
      started unraveling. I was the novice in computer science domain in the first year of
      the undergraduate program, so I started focusing more on subjects like Basics of
      Computer Science, Data structure, and Algorithm, languages like C, C++.
      Although I wasn’t very familiar with programming languages, being good at mathematics
      helped me to grasp the concepts and solve complex problems faster.
      And after learning and practicing theoretical concepts for one year,
      I was ready with a strong background in the fundamentals of Computer Science.
      To get the hands-on experience of my learnings on programming languages,
      I started participating in various programming contests and won many of them.
      After undergraduate program as wished, I got the chance to work in database development team.
      I worked as a core member of the development team of various projects
      like Risk Adjustment for payer-physician-patient-partner collaboration in US Healthcare,
      Sure-Metrics for the Analysis of Healthcare Data and also lead one project for
      Building Provider-Patient-Ipa-Medical Group Architecture. Although I got the answers to my childhood questions,
      my eagerness to learn analytics and subjects like Data Science in depth kept increasing.
      And that is how I ended up here at University of Texas at Dallas. </p>
